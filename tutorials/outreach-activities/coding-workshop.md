# Coding Workshop

We developed a coding workshop for Rainstorm Summer 2020 to teach high-schoolers about algorithms in a 25 minute session through zoom. This activity is designed for students with no previous experience with programming.

There are 3 variations to this activity: elementary school level for Scientific Adventures for Girls, high school level \(25 minutes\) for Rainstorm, and high school level \(55 minutes\) for Splash @ Berkeley.
