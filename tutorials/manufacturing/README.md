# Manufacturing

Broadly speaking, this section covers how to select materials, how to manufacture parts out of stock, and how to choose / work with parts that you cannot manufacture yourself.

If you're just getting started, we recommend going through the 3D Printing and Laser cutting tutorials; refer to the Material Properties and Uses page as needed:

{% page-ref page="3d-printing-fdm.md" %}

{% page-ref page="laser-cutting.md" %}

{% page-ref page="fablight-metal-laser-cutter.md" %}

{% page-ref page="general-material-properties-and-uses.md" %}

If you have more experience or are a little farther along in the design process, check out some of our other tutorials on how to use commercial parts or where to source stock from:

{% page-ref page="general-fasteners.md" %}

{% page-ref page="tolerancing.md" %}

{% page-ref page="suppliers.md" %}

{% page-ref page="8020-extrusions.md" %}

For more specialized needs, we have a few tutorials on more advanced manufacturing methods:
