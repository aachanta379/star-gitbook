# FabLight: Metal Laser Cutter

## Overview

For more information about the process of using the FabLight \(e.g., preparing and loading a file/CAD drawing\) and a full list of approved materials, please visit the [**Jacobs bCourses page**](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1353091/pages/fablight-laser). In a non-COVID year, both the online quiz and in-person training is required prior to being able to use the FabLight.

The FabLight is **more precise** than a water jet and has a less steep learning curve. In a non-COVID year, it is also **more available** due to being located in the general all-purpose makerspaces \(studios 110 and 120\) and not the metal shop with its more limited hours. For Jacobs Project Support during COVID, the FabLight similarly has a **faster turnaround** time and can produce parts more quickly once a request is received.

The disadvantage is that the FabLight of course cannot cut through as thick materials as a water jet. The maximum thickness that a STAR member has previously cut through on the FabLight without issue is 1/8" stainless steel. 

## History of Use

**November 2020**: The Payload subteam successfully laser cut leaf springs for the Bear Force One payload structure out of **1/32" 6061 aluminum**, available through the Jacobs Material store.
