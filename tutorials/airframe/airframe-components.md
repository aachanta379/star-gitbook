# Airframe Components

## Tubing

Tubing is probably the essential airframe component as it makes up almost all of the exterior structure and shape of the rocket. Historically, we have mainly used BlueTube as our default tubing material, but we are moving towards carbon fiber for our larger rocket designs as it offers a great combination of strength and low weight.

### Payload Tube

The Payload Tube is the tube dedicated to housing the payload, whatever it may be. This is generally directly under the nose cone as the payload is often partially stored in the nose cone as well to efficiently utilize all available space. 

### Avionics Bay \(Av Bay\)

The Avionics Bay \(or Av Bay\) houses all of the electrical boards, flight computers, and avionics of the rocket. As this is a very delicate section of the rocket, it is generally closed/sealed on both ends by bulkheads. It also usually has a door, sled, or other form of access so the Avionics team can access the boards at anytime time, even when the rocket is on the launch rail.

### Recovery Tube

The Recovery Tube houses the parachutes \(and supporting recovery components\) of the rocket. This section of the rocket has to be able to separate to allow the parachutes to release after apogee has been reached. In the past this separation has been done via black powder. 

### Booster Tube

The Booster Tube is at the bottom of the rocket and houses the motor. It is generally sealed off from the rest of the rocket.

### **Couplers**

Couplers are tubes that work as connecting sections of the rocket that have a slightly smaller diameter than the rocket itself, so that they can fit snugly inside of it and allow different rocket tube sections to mate. They are permanently attached to these tube sections and generally made out of the same material as the main tubing. 

## Bulkheads

Bulkheads are the "dividing walls" of the rocket or in other words structural sealing tools that are fitted inside the tube and comprise the entire area of the inner tube. They are used to seal off sections of the rocket where we do not want any interaction, such as between the motor and whatever is above it. They are also used as structural mounting spots for things like parachute u-bolts. Sometimes they have holes so that pipes can pass through them. Historically, we have made these out of wood. We are planning to use acrylic for our larger rockets.

## Centering Rings

Centering rings are structural tools used to hold things in place inside of the rocket. They are similar to bulkheads except that they have a hollow center \(ring instead of circle\). We have used them to secure the payload in the nose cone and secure the motor tube inside of the booster tube. When used to center the motor, they should be strong enough to withstand high impulses that the motor produces during flight. Historically, we have made these out of wood. We are planning to use aluminum for our larger rockets. 

## Nose Cone

The cone shaped nose of the rocket that is designed to reduce drag at the front end/top of the rocket. We generally go for nose cones that are made of carbon fiber and have a 4:1 length to diameter ratio \(a 6in diameter rocket would have a 24 in length nose cone\). 

## Transition Piece

A custom piece of tubing that is made to facilitate a diameter transition in a rocket. For example, a transition piece was used in Arktos to transition from a 6in diameter \(nose cone and payload tube\) to a 4in diameter \(recovery, booster, av bay\). Transition pieces allow for versatility by allowing certain parts of the rocket to house larger diameters without requiring the entire rocket to commit to the larger size.

## Fins

A stabilizing agent that is fitted to the bottom of the rocket. 

## Tail Cone

Similar to the nose cone, but at the very end of the rocket. A tail cone exists to buffer the change at the bottom of the rocket from "whatever diameter" to nothing \(i.e. where the rocket ends\). Adding in a piece that gives a gradual change in diameter helps to eliminate drag and achieve a higher apogee.
