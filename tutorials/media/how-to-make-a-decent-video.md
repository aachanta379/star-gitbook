# How to make a decent video

* There are many existing tutorials out there on the web that probably will provide a more detailed step-by-step procedure and description on features of Premiere Pro. 
  * [https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/15-premiere-pro-tutorials-every-video-editor-watch/](https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/15-premiere-pro-tutorials-every-video-editor-watch/)
* So here, we'll talk about **what information you'd want to put in** for a club promotional video. 
* Promotional Videos

  * Objective
    * Recruitment: to attract audiences/ potential members to our club
    * Crowdfunding: to attract donors/sponsors for financial support ex\) Crowdfunding  
  * Depending on the objective, what content you want to include in your video will change!

* **Recruitment Videos**
  * Emphasize the variety of subteams we have \(technical AND non-technical\)
    * technical subteams: emphasize **projects** with short descriptions with **minimal jargon**  
    * non-technical subteams: emphasize the impact they have/ the **non-trivial** role they play in the club
  * present our **long term and short term goals** so students understand what our team's vision is
  * Photos
    * insert images of social activities we have inside and outside the designated club events \(i.e. outside of General Meetings\)
    * Clips from our launches are _always_ a crowd pleaser
    * general tips
      * sync the audio and the visuals so that the visuals aid whatever the audio recording talks about
      * transitions look less choppy with 'Cross Dissolve' or fades
* **Crowdfunding Videos**
  * Emphasize the variety of subteams we have \(technical AND non-technical\)
    * technical subteams: emphasize the significance and diversity of  **projects** within the club
    * non-technical subteams: always include how we aim to give back to the community through education and outreach \(not only because we actually prioritize this, but donors love that ;\) \)
  * present our **long term and short term goals** so donors understand what our team's vision is
  * Photos
    * Clips from our launches are _always_ a crowd pleaser
    * As mentioned before, outreach images are also crucial
    * CADs and layouts/schematics of our projects also spotlight the intellectual value in the projects we do and the knowledge we pursuit. 
  * Including videos of people talking \(i.e. interview clip\) always adds a nice humanly touch to the otherwise money-hungry typical crowdfunding video
