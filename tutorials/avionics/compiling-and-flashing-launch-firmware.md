# Compiling and Flashing Launch Firmware

This page assumes you have installed VirtualBox and Vagrant, as these are the standard virtual environments we use to compile STAR code. If you have not done so yet, please refer to the[ Development Environment](mbed-command-line-interface-cli-tools.md#vagrant) tutorial.

Choose a desired directory and

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/calstar/firmware-launch.git
```

Or, if you have your ssh keys set up on your laptop and shared to Github, run

```text
$ git clone git@github.com:/calstar/firmware-launch.git
```

## Git Submodules

See the Git page, linked blow, for more details on submodules.

{% page-ref page="git-and-workflow.md" %}

All libraries are stored in a separate repository for ease of updating libraries across different repos. After you clone a repo, you will have to run the following to download the tools. Run these commands from the working directory of the repo \(eg for the repo `firmware-launch`, run from `/vagrant/firmware-launch`\).

```text
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If there are issues with the above commands regarding permissions, you may have to follow the Github guide [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to create an SSH-key and then put it on your Github.
{% endhint %}

and navigate to this launch-firmware directory.

## Installing mbed-os

If you are compiling for the first time, you will need to first install mbed-os. `vagrant ssh` to connect to Vagrant and then run:

`cd ~ && mkdir -p mbed && cd mbed && git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os.git`

`cd mbed-os/ && git checkout mbed-os-5.15 && cd /vagrant && mbed config -G MBED_OS_DIR /home/vagrant/mbed/mbed-os`

Add `--source . --source /home/vagrant/mbed` to the Makefile you are compiling from.

Make sure ~/mbed/mbed-os is the only mbed-os folder you have in your projects otherwise you will get this: `[ERROR] Library name 'device_key' is not unique` when trying to compile

{% hint style="warning" %}
If `mbed deploy` fails with a message like `could not resolve host: github.com`, try following answers on this stackoverflow post: [https://serverfault.com/questions/453185/vagrant-virtualbox-dns-10-0-2-3-not-working](https://serverfault.com/questions/453185/vagrant-virtualbox-dns-10-0-2-3-not-working). In particular the answers on this post wil resolve DNS issues. If, within the VM, `ping 1.1.1.1` works but not `ping google.com` this may indicate a DNS issue.
{% endhint %}

## C++ Settings

Our launch firmware uses flatbuffers, which requires the c++14 compile standard. To change these settings, ensure you are in your VM then `cd /home/vagrant/mbed-os/tools/profiles` directory. Edit the three json files. Under `GCC_ARM` and `cxx,`change the `-std`flag to be `c++14`. When you are done, the three json files should look something like this at the top:

## Compiling

```text
$ make build board=[tpc|fc|gs|bb]
```

For example, if you want to compile TPC firmware, run

```text
$ make build board=tpc
```
