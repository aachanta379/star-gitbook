# Project Management

## What is Trello?

Probably best said by [Trello itself](https://trello.com/).

Trello is a project management software which allows us to track tasks which need to be done, what stage projects are in, and what everyone is working on. It helps streamline our workflow by making sure we always know what we have done, what we are doing, and what we have left to do.
