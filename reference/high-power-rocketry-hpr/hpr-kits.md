## HPR Kits

### LOC Precision

LOC kits can be found at [https://locprecision.com/](https://locprecision.com/) and from resellers like Apogee. 

#### Materials

LOC kits are are sold exclusively with cardboard/paper body tubes \(although you can separately replace the tubes with phenolic\). This is true of all diameters offered by LOC.

LOC offers standard laser-cut plywood fins and bulkheads/centering rings.

LOC kits come with plastic nose cones.

#### Price and Extras

LOC kits tend to be cheaper than many competitors; this is partially a result of their somewhat less-robust materials. However, LOC kits also often include more "extras" at the same price point. 

Many LOC kits include a parachute and flame protector \(~$30+\), which can simplify the buying process as they do not have to be bought separately \(+ shipping!\). Like other manufacturers, quick-links and swivels \(optional\) for recovery are not included.

As is the case with most kits, you will likely have to buy a motor retainer separately. You will also have to buy any motors you plan to fly and motor hardware \(casing, closures\) if applicable. Also factor in the cost of adhesives \(epoxy or wood glue\) into your planning.

### Madcow Rocketry

In addition to selling individual components, Madcow offers a number of Madcow-designed-and-sold kits at [https://www.madcowrocketry.com/kits/](https://www.madcowrocketry.com/kits/).

#### Materials

While Madcow carries kits in cardboard, fiberglass, and carbon fiber, the majority of L1-range Madcow kits use fiberglass body tubes, with a number of cardboard options as well. Larger kits in the L2 and L3 range tend to be made from composite \(fiberglass or carbon fiber\) body tubes, but Madcow does offer some cardboard 5.5" kits.

Madcow offers standard laser-cut plywood fins and bulkheads/centering rings with cardboard kits, and fiberglass fins and bulkheads/centering rings for fiberglass kits.

Fiberglass kits come with fiberglass nose cones, while cardboard kits come with plastic nose cones.

#### Price and Extras

Madcow kits tend to be on the more expensive side, but this perception can be inflated by the greater number of fiberglass and carbon fiber products. Even at standard cardboard kit price points though, Madcow tends to include fewer \(but often higher-quality\) components. For example, Madcow kits usually ship with nylon shock cord while many competitors offer elastic shock cord on smaller rockets. 

Madcow kits do not commonly include the cost of parachutes and flame protectors in the list price, which can make them seem deceptively cheaper \(~$30+\) than the actual cost of buying and flying the kit. Like other manufacturers, quick-links and swivels \(optional\) for recovery are not included.

As is the case with most kits, you will likely have to buy a motor retainer separately. You will also have to buy any motors you plan to fly and motor hardware \(casing, closures\) if applicable. Also factor in the cost of adhesives \(epoxy or wood glue\) into your planning.

### Public Missiles

Public Missiles has several categories of kits, but the most applicable for L1 and L2 fliers are the Sport Kits: [https://publicmissiles.com/kits/sportfliers](https://publicmissiles.com/kits/sportfliers).

#### Materials

Public Missiles \(PML\) kits are almost exclusively offered with proprietary Quantum Tube \(QT\) airframes. PML markets QT as a more durable option than cardboard, but less brittle than phenolic. QT is _not_ the same thing as Blue Tube \(from Always Ready Rocketry\). 

PML kits come standard with G-10 fiberglass fins, although these are also much thinner than the common laser-cut plywood fins found on cardboard kits.

QT kits come with plastic nose cones.
