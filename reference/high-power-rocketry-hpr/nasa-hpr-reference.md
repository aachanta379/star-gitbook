# NASA HPR Reference

## Videos

These videos cover the basics of high power rocketry as it related to hobbyists and college teams. Feel free to skip or fast-forward through the slow parts, but on the whole these are relevant and useful to what we do. The target audience is NASA Student Launch teams--a competition STAR has competed in!

## Written Reference

NASA has also nicely compiled all the information needed for L1- and L2-level HPR projects into a ~100-page written document! Check it out here if you're not a fan of watching videos, or if you want a more detailed guide to accompany the videos: [https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/sl\_video\_instruction\_book.pdf](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/sl_video_instruction_book.pdf)
