# HPR Suppliers

## Where to Get Stuff

* [Bay Area Rocketry](http://bayarearocketry.com/)
  * Buy motors here. BAR is an on-site supplier at almost every NorCal launch.
  * Call beforehand to make sure your item is actually in stock \(do not trust website\), then order online for pickup at launch. 
    * Increase your chances of getting your order by picking it up before launch, and ordering two weeks in advance.

  * Also carries motor hardware \(casings, closures\), although stock may be limited for closures and seal discs.
* [Animal Motor Works](http://cart.amwprox.com/)
  * The on-site motor supplier for IREC. Sometimes comes up to TCC, but rarely as they are based in Arizona. Can order online, but careful with shipping fees.
  * Carries almost exclusively Cesaroni motors, although can source large Aerotech orders given enough lead time.
