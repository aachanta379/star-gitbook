| Regenerative Cooling |  | Regenerative cooling, in the context of rocket engine design, is a configuration in which some or all of the propellant is passed through tubes, channels, or in a jacket around the combustion chamber or nozzle to cool the engine. This serves two purposes: 1\) it cools the combustion chamber and 2\) it warms the fuel -- making the combustion reaction more efficient. \[1\] |
| Ablative Cooling |  | With ablative cooling, combustion gas-side wall material is sacrificed by melting, vaporization and chemical changes to dissipate heat. As a result, relatively cool gases flow over the wall surface, thus lowering the boundary-layer temperature and assisting the cooling process. |
| Film Cooling |  | Film cooling is used in many applications to reduce convective heat transfer to a surface. Gas which is cooler than the freestream is passed onto the external surface via small slots or rows of holes within the surface. The aim is to introduce the coolant into the boundary layer without significantly increasing turbulence and entraining additional hot freestream gas. \[[1](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA234288.pdf)\] \[[2](http://dept.me.umn.edu/labs/tcht/measurements/what.html)\] \[[3](http://thermopedia.com/content/759/)\] |
| Water cooling |  | Water cooling uses water instead of existing propellant to cool the system. \[[1](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/486409.pdf)\] |
