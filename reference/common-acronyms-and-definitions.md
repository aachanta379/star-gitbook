  Here are some common acronyms from STAR, NASA, or engineering in general.
  There's no shame in not knowing something! Please correct this if something is
  wrong/unclear or add it if it's missing.

# Common Acronyms and Definitions

**ABS**: A 3D printing plastic made from Acrylonitrile, Butadiene, and Styrene polymers.  
**BOM**: Bill of Materials. A list of the materials that go in to an engineering assembly or design.  
**CAD**: Computer Aided Design. The usage of computer software \(i.e. SolidWorks\) to design parts or assemblies.  
**CAM**: Computer Aided Machining. The use of a computer program to plan toolpaths, usually for waterjet or CNC, but sometimes used in the context of additive manufacturing.  
**CDR**: Critical Design Review. A step of the NASA design review process intended to assess a final design and technical challenges that may occur in the fabrication and testing process.  
**CFD**: Computational Fluid Dynamics. Using a computer to analyze the movement of a liquid in a specific instance. Common uses include engine propellant flow and wing lift analyses.  
**CNC**: Computer Numeric Control. Basically, using a computer to control the motion of a manufacturing machine, most commonly a mill, lathe, or waterjet cutter. Sometimes used to describe additive manufacturing / 3D printing.  
**ESRA**: Experimental Sounding Rocket Association, the organization that runs the SAC/IREC competition.  
**FEA** \(also **FEM**\): Finite Element Analysis or Modelling. Using a computer program to calculate the strength of a mechanical part and its resistance to different load cases.  
**FMEA** \(also **FMECA**\): Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. A required analysis for NASA projects that details the potential failure points of a design and the resultant risks to both safety and function.  
**FRR** \(also **MRR**\): Flight/Mission Readiness Review. A step of the NASA design review process intended to assess a project's readiness for launch and evaluate the rigor of its design, construction, and testing.  
**GD&T:** Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing. An engineering practice to precisely specify how a part should be shaped or constructed.  
**IREC** \(also **SAC**\): Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition or Spaceport America Cup. A custom rocket design competition run by ESRA.  
**NASA SL** \(also **SLI**, **USLI**\): NASA \(University\) Student Launch \(Initiative\). The largest and most well-known collegiate rocketry competition. Run by NASA out of Marshall Space Flight Center, it follows the NASA design review process through the entire competition.  
**PDR**: Preliminary Design Review. A step of the NASA design review process intended to assess a design's architecture and what problems may arise from it in very broad strokes.  
**PDM**: Product Data Management. A tool used to keep track of revisions to data, files and other project-related information. Examples include Grabcad workbench and GitHub.  
**PLA**: Polylactic Acid. Another very common 3D printing plastic.  
**SW:** SolidWorks, a CAD and FEA tool with free educational licenses. It is our team's primary CAD software.
