  Discord or talk with Trevor to learn about the requirements for the Fall 2020
  intro project.

# Propulsion

![Ignition Testing for LE-165](../.gitbook/assets/ignitiontesting.PNG)

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to ensure that new and returning members research various parts of a rocket propulsion system from both theoretical and practical engineering points of view. The document containing the entire timeline can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RTEm9aAbXjOoAq3cZLYRdd0aQFkFVtegp608mWr5KFw/edit)

Your project should be completed with your intro project group.

### Returning Members

Returning members have no special requirements for Spring 2020. It is highly recommended to attend workshops and the Feed System Presentations hosted by Trevor.

If you are interested in contributing to a workshop \(highly encouraged\), please contact Trevor via Discord.

### Contact

If you have any questions about any part of the question at any time \(even if it's 4AM on a weekend\), do not hesitate to reach out to the propulsion lead \(Trevor\) or the propulsion deputy \(Jeremy\). Discord is preferred, but if you are having difficulty getting started with Discord, Email is fine.

    \(exact location may vary, will be announced on Discord\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
This project is intended to challenge you a little bit! You are not expected to know everything you need for this project going in, and it will almost certainly be necessary for you to ask questions and interact with the team lead, propulsion members, and of course your mentor. This is by design, and is intended to get you familiar with our workflow and asking for help when needed. If you feel intimidated by the intro project, please please please reach out to others! Everybody wants you to succeed!
{% endhint %}

##  In-Person Component

To satisfy the in-person component, you must attend **one** of the following events:

* Safety Workshop \(Will be 2 dates, TBA\)

In addition to attending a safety session, you are required to attend **one** of the following events. If you have time to attend more than one, you are encouraged to do so.

* Manufacturing workshop \(TBA\)
* Quantitative Analysis workshop \(TBA\)

Lastly, once you believe you have finished your intro project, you should schedule a time with Trevor during office hours to go over your submission. If you are super busy and can't find a time, then talk to me and we can sort something out.

## Week 1:
First and foremost, we'd like to tell you about some of the projects going on in the Propulsion subteam and also tell you about what we do in general. You can attend an intro meeting presentation or view one of our recorded presentations[here.] If you can't make it in person for whatever reason, please let either Trevor or Jeremy know so they can answer any further question you may have and put you into a group with a mentor. You could do the entire project alone, but that's an unnecessary amount of work and we would all like to get to know you sooner! 

## Week 2. 
Time for some fancy book learnin'! NASA created [this](https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/05_Practical_Rocketry.pdf) document to talk about rocket propulsion in general and some of the ways you can make and use a rocket motor. A bit more advanced and optional reading that goes into more detail can be found [here](http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm).

There are also the slides your group must fill out. Within your team, you can divide the tasks however you want to. To help out with the slides, we have a couple more readings for you. 
Some readings you'll find helpful are 
  * [A pros and cons comparison between solid and liquid motors](thoughtco.com/how-rockets-work-1992379)
  * [A bit more in depth analysis on solid and liquid fuels](http://www.braeunig.us/space/propel.htm)
  * [Solid rocket fuel mixtures and channel patterns](https://science.howstuffworks.com/rocket.htm) (you only need to read the solid rocket parts)
  * [An exerpt from Rocket Propulsion Elements about ](https://wodeshu.gitee.io/roprop/text00004.html#c01) (section 1.2 up to figure 1-6 talks about liquid and solid motors, section 6.3 and 6.4 up to table 6-5 talks about differet types of feed systems)
  * [How a regulator works](https://www.fluidcontrols.co.uk/how-pressure-regulators-work/#:~:text=Here%20is%20a%20small%20overview,fluctuations%20in%20the%20inlet%20pressure.&text=If%20the%20load%20flow%20decreases,regulator%20flow%20must%20decrease%20also.)
  
## Week 3.
Like Week 2, but with a focus on injectors and thrust chambers of liquid propulsion systems. 
  * [Another exerpt from Rocket Propulsion Elements](https://wodeshu.gitee.io/roprop/text00011.html#c08)(Relevant bit is section 8.1 up to figure 8-6 and section 8.2)
  * [A bit about specifically pintle injectors](http://pintleinjector.blogspot.com/2016/12/pintle-injector.html)
  * [Cooling methods](https://aeronotes.weebly.com/cooling-in-liquid-rocket.html)

## Week 4-5.
Now you should be prepared to design your very own very basic liquid rocket engine. First, let's go over some of the resources you'll have at your disposal. 
  * A parts list of various valves, tanks, piping types, etc. that you'll say you'll use for your design that will be made availible when you get to this point.
  * A video presentation series that Trevor gave in the Spring of 2020 which goes over a liquid engine design, piping components, how to read a P&ID diagram, and how to understand procedures. 
  * [This tutorial on how to use Rocket Propulsion Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3W3zZj4zX4) (There are more tutorials elsewhere on this Gitbook)
  * Of course, you always have your mentor, other people in your group, and feel free to message Trevor or Jeremy.
  
As for your design, you'll have to present three different things: your feed system design, thrust chamber design, and a cost estimate plus basic procedures

Feed system design:
  * Pressure fed or blowdown system? Both are correct choices, but you must justify why you chose one over the other
  * The list of componants is extensive. Your team must choose which ones are best and make sure they work with the rest of the parts
  
Thrust chamber design:
  * Here are some design restraints
    * 1000 lbf engine fueled by keorsene and liquid oxygen
    * Oxidizer/Fuel ratio is 2.5
    * The feed system can supply up to 1200psi feed pressure, and an injection pressure drop of 250psi will be used.
      * Based on this, what is a reasonable chamber pressure?
    * Must fit in a 7.5" diameter airframe
    * 1 atm ambient air pressure
  * Pintle or impinging injector system? Like before, both are correct but you have to say why you chose one over the other.
  * Include some rough sketches of your injector design. If you know how to make a design that can be machined, then include that. If you don't know, don't worry about that because it's a rather advanced skill.
  * Using Rocket Propulsion Analysis software, determine the thrust chamber size and shape
  * A total impulse of 30,000 N⋅s is desired. Using the mass flow rates derived in RPA, determine the mass of each propellant required, as well as the associated volume of the fuel tanks.
  
Cost Estimate and Procedures:
  * Create a spreadsheet with all the componants and their costs
  * Basic procedures should be written from a template for your system for filling the fuel tank and for testing the flow rate.
  
## Final Presentation 
Prepare a slide deck to be presented to your mentor, Propulsion lead, and Propulsion deputy. Anyone who wants to come and watch, including members of other groups, may also do so. A rubric will be used to provide feedback on every group’s presentation. The presentation is not meant to be hard, and putting in a minimal amount of effort is enough to complete it. The rubric will be used to provide feedback on the group’s design and project immediately after their presentation. 

Good luck, have fun!
