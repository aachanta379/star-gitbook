description: Business intro project for Fall 2020

# Business

## Introduction

Business has three main areas this year:
1) Crowdfunding and grant applications
2) Develop corporate relationships
3) Develop STAR’s brand image

Whilst I would love to make you fill out grants so I don’t have to, we won’t touch on crowdfunding or grant applications in the intro project. Instead, you will simulate developing a corporate relationship in the first part of the intro project, and create a plan for an event to boost STAR’s brand image for the second part.

## Part 1: Aerospace Rocketry Systems Engineering proposal 

The propulsion lead has messaged Business asking if we could source some cheap swagelok valves because they’ve burned through their (already disproportionately large) budget again. Rather than telling them they can have more money when they actually launch a working engine, we agree and try to develop a relationship with a company that has an abundance of valves they may be willing to give us.

A member of the team has an aunt at ‘Aerospace Rocketry Systems Engineering’ (A fictitious company made up for the purpose of this project). The member has E-mailed their aunt, who has agreed to give our business team their contact information so we can reach out to them. 

‘Aerospace Rocketry Systems Engineering’ is a 300 person company, and the member’s aunt is a mid-level systems engineer (meaning she manages a team, but is not part of the senior management team).

Task 1: Write an E-mail to the member’s aunt, Ms. Slartybartfast. The purpose of the E-mail is to ask for a zoom meeting where you can tell them more information about STAR and what we do. (You should not ask for the valves at this point - you should only ask for a meeting). 

NOTE: Receive feedback on task 1 from the Business lead BEFORE starting task 2

Task 2:  Create a powerpoint presentation which shows off the work STAR does. The opening slides should contain our three pillars and our goals for this year - the subsequent slides should be one slide per subteam, with a sentence or two about what that subteam is hoping to achieve this year, and what their biggest achievement last year was. The penultimate slide should contain some information about last year’s budget, and how much we spent on each subteam, and the final slide should contain ‘the ask’ (you asking if we could have any free swagelok valves).

The purpose of task 2 is to familiarize you not only with making pitches, but also with the team - it’s important for Business to know what’s going on in the team. Please feel free to message the business lead with questions on where to find information (I will be very surprised if you do not message me asking for information.) To find out information about specific sub teams, please message the deputies of the sub-team, rather than the leads (leads are very busy and I do not want to generate work for them in the form of having to answer the same question a dozen times). 

## Part 2: STAR’s brand image

Part 2 of the intro project is designed to test your creativity and your organisational skills.

This year, we are hoping to really start developing STAR’s brand image so that the name carries even more weight with employers, and across campus. One example of how we are doing this is by running events for students at Berkeley. We are planning to show a screening of a space related film this semester, and invite all Berkeley engineering students to join us. The idea is that by running an event for the wider engineering community through STAR, it gives us a method to subtly highlight the work we’ve been doing, and build our reputation on campus. We would also invite corporate partners to join us to show how big our reach on campus is. 

I would like you to come up with an idea to boost STAR’s brand image (it can be anything from an event, to a social media campaign, to a publicity stunt, or anything at all!). You should then plan out the logistics to a good level of detail for how you would accomplish this event. The ‘logistics’ only needs to be a list of tasks which need to be completed before the idea happens - you do not need to give a timeline or a budget breakdown. (Aren’t I nice). 

An example for the film event is given below:

Idea: Run a film event online for all college of engineering students, also inviting our biggest sponsors, to boost STAR’s reach on campus

Logistics:
Find streaming platform
Create invites
Create mailing list
Send out invites
Get permission to show film
Etc. 

(The etc. is here because I am lazy - you are not lazy and so should create a more comprehensive list.)
