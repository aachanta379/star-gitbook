description: Business intro project for Fall 2020

# Business

## Introduction

Business has three main areas this year:
* Crowdfunding and grant applications
* Develop corporate relationships
* Develop STAR’s brand image

Whilst I would love to make you fill out grants so I don’t have to, we won’t touch on crowdfunding or grant applications in the intro project. Instead, you will simulate developing a corporate relationship in the first part of the intro project, and create a plan for an event to boost STAR’s brand image for the second part.
